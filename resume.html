        <h3>Technical Projects</h3>
        <h6>Photo Filtering</h6>
        <p>My senior year of high school, I completed an independent project that involved image filtering using python. I took and developed
            photos with my film camera, and then uploaded them to my computer to edit them. I basically looped through all the pixels in each 
            photo and made some adjustment to color. I gave some black and white photos color and adjusted the contrast or darkness on others.
        </p>

        <h6>Website Development</h6>
        <p>My cousin coded a website for voter registration in the summer of 2020. I helped her with the asthetics of the website and learned
            a tiny bit about html, but was mostly involved in the data and information side of things.
        </p>

        <h6>Expression Evaluator</h6>
        <p>In CSCI 261 last semester, I worked with a partner to create an expression evaluator in java. It used stacks and nodes to break down
            and evaluate an arithmetic expression.

        <h3>Affiliations</h3>
        <p>I am a member of the women's lacrosse team and the club ski team. Clubs weren't really running last year but I'm starting to get involved in a few. I've
            joined Puget Sound Outdoors, kayaking club, mountain biking club, investment club, and Women in Computing and Mathematics. I haven't
            been to meetings for any of them yet, but some are going to start with meetings this week.
