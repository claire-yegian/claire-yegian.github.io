        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Claire, and I'm originally from Colorado. I went to high school in 
            New Hampshire, and now go to college in Washington. I love being outside, seeing 
            new things, and listening to the Harry Potter books on tape. When I care about 
            something, I'll take initiative and fight for it. I've done a fair bit of traveling, 
            backpacking, and tried my hand a lot of obscure sports, most of which I was mediocre 
            at at best. I'm on the Lacrosse team at UPS. Although I'm new to the sport, I think 
            my ice hockey skills translate well, and I'm glad I have the opportunity to be on a 
            team. I love the competition, companionship, and physical challenge of team sports.
            
            I'm taking classes in software engineering, statistics, intro to world religions, 
            and online communication right now. I love my religion class in particular because 
            the reading is so fascinating and the material I'm learning is giving me a broader 
            world view. I'm also enjoying software engineering quite a bit. I'm currently thinking 
            I'll be a computer science major. I love the problem solving aspect of it and the 
            feeling of accomplishment I get when fixing a bug. I also think it will give me a lot 
            of opportunities in an increasingly computerized world. I am passionate about 
            protecting the environment, and I hope to be able to use my computer skills in a 
            profession that allows me to contribute to the world in a sustainable and beneficial 
            way.
